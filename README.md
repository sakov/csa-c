(Cubic Spline Approximation)

**csa** is a C code for cubic spline approximation of 2D scattered data. It provides a C library and a command line utility **csabathy**.

**csa** uses a fast O(N) and robust algorithm that works nicely for uniformly distributed data. It is described in [this](http://csa-c.googlecode.com/files/VIS2001.pdf) paper. For clustered data you may prefer Natural Neighbours interpolation.
